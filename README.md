# GUI-for-arm-machine

Using the basic serial port to communicate with the arm-machine. 

115200, No parity, 8bits, 1 stop bits

Choose using wireless communication or use usb-2-serial cables. default is wireless

Wireless module is using LORA, which has long range, expecially for our housing project. 
Much better than WIFI, which can only cover a very small range. By the way, we don't need any router our network-card, 
only a very small module plug into the PC or laptop, and this software can be ready to use.

Our arm-machine can only locate in a very small certain range, if the input value is our of range, there will be some message box to show the error. So feel free to input any value.
